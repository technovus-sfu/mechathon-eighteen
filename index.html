                                   Great solutions come when many people with different backgrounds put their minds together. We’re accepting students from all backgrounds as long as they are over the age of 18.
There will also be mentors and workshops in both the health and tech industry to give you all an even playing field.

                                Don’t worry, there are many people that sign up by themselves for Mechathon. On the day of the event, we will run an activity that will help you meet new people and form a team.

                                    Mechathon is an inclusive community that strives to help bring in interdisciplinary teams. It is your team’s passion, strategy, and presentation that will matter the most. In the past, some of our participants were able to get their ideas across with hand-made drawings. 

                                    Additionally, we will have both technical and non-technical awards and a basic beginner robotics crash course for non-technical people.

                                    We recommend you to bring whatever you think you need so that you can brainstorm, design, and build. Bring a laptop and something to take notes with. We will have some basic hardware available for you such as cardboard, micro-controllers, sensors, LED’s , and soldering stations. A complete list of the hardware we will have available will be released closer to the event. 

                                    Also, wear something comfortable so that you can focus all of your efforts on innovating and problem solving!

She is internationally recognized as a 3D printing, drone, robotics, telemedicine and digital health pioneer who uses cutting-edge technology to deliver healthcare solutions in diverse environments, from outer space to remote communities with limited access to healthcare resources. She was the first to 3D print medical supplies onboard the International Space Station and at the Mars Desert Research Station.  She designed a solar-powered mobile 3D printing system that can be transported in a carry-on suitcase to produce medical supplies in remote, off-grid communities.  Julielynn regularly lectures on innovation in healthcare and is a frequent contributor to various media outlets including ABC News, Forbes, and the Huffington Post. </p>
