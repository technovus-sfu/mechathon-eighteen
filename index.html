                                    Mechathon is an inclusive community that strives to help bring in interdisciplinary teams. It is your team’s passion, strategy, and presentation that will matter the most. In the past, some of our participants were able to get their ideas across with hand-made drawings. 

                                    Additionally, we will have both technical and non-technical awards and a basic beginner robotics crash course for non-technical people.

                                    We recommend you to bring whatever you think you need so that you can brainstorm, design, and build. Bring a laptop and something to take notes with. We will have some basic hardware available for you such as cardboard, micro-controllers, sensors, LED’s , and soldering stations. A complete list of the hardware we will have available will be released closer to the event. 

                                    Also, wear something comfortable so that you can focus all of your efforts on innovating and problem solving!
